# Data Source

1. Download file and unzip
  1.1. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  
# Cleaning
  
2. Read in everthing and set column names
3. Merge train and test sets
4. Extract columns with mean and standard deviations
5. Change activity ID to name and assign descriptive column names
6. Make the independent tidy data set by using the activity and subject to get a mean of each variable
